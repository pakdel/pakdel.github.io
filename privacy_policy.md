==============
Namak does not gather or send out any data.

It merely stores Salt API credentials locally on the device,
in order to be able to send Salt Commands to the server.

None of the credentials, communications or other data are sent
anywhere other than the Salt server that user sets up, and it is
only done when the users requests those actions.
